# My development configuration

## Key bindings

### Installing key bindings in vs code

Copy the keybindings.json file into the vs code user settings folder

```cmd
cp keybindings.json c:\users\emilb\appdata\roaming\code\user\keybindings.json
```

### Installing key bindings in rider

Copy the rider-keymap.xml file into rider's user keymap filder

```cmd
mkdir C:\users\emilb\appdata\roaming\JetBrains\Rider2024.2\keymaps
cp rider-keymap.xml C:\users\emilb\appdata\roaming\JetBrains\Rider2024.2\keymaps\rider-keymap.xml
```

But I think I have to first create a custom keymap in the program and save it first.
Otherwise the new keymap files don't show up.
